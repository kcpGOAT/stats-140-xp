## EDA

summary(crime_df)

table(crime_df$month) |> barplot()

table(crime_df$season)[c(2, 3, 1, 4)] |> barplot()

table(crime_df$period_day) |> barplot()

table(crime_df$status) |> barplot()

table(crime_df$month) |> 
  barplot(main = "Crimes by Month", col = "lightblue", xlab = "Month", ylab = "Frequency")

# Crimes by Season
table(crime_df$season)[c(2, 3, 1, 4)] |> 
  barplot(main = "Crimes by Season", col = "lightgreen", xlab = "Season", ylab = "Frequency")

# Crimes by Period of the Day
table(crime_df$period_day) |> 
  barplot(main = "Crimes by Period of the Day", col = "orange", xlab = "Period of Day", ylab = "Frequency")

# Crimes by Status
table(crime_df$status) |> 
  barplot(main = "Crimes by Status", col = "pink", xlab = "Status", ylab = "Frequency")


## ANALYSIS ZERO (?)

period_count <- crime_df %>%
  group_by(period_day) %>%
  count()

### Result: There are more crimes in the evening than in the morning and afternoon combined.

## ANALYSIS ONE

crime_season <- crime_df %>%
  group_by(season, type_crime) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  mutate(rank = dense_rank(1 / n))

crime_season_results <- crime_season %>%
  filter(rank <= 3)

### Result: The type of crime is generally constant by season.
###         Best explanation is that LA's weather is generally mild.

## ANALYSIS TWO

crime_period <- crime_df %>%
  group_by(period_day, type_crime) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(period_day) %>%
  mutate(rank = dense_rank(1 / n))

crime_period_results <- crime_period %>%
  filter(rank <= 3)

### Result: The most common crime in the afternoon is battery assault, while 
###         the most common crimes in the morning and evening are vehicle theft.

## ANALYSIS THREE

crime_status <- crime_df %>%
  group_by(type_crime) %>%
  filter(n() > 5000) %>%
  summarize(prop_resolved = sum(status != "IC") / sum(!is.na(status))) %>%
  arrange(-prop_resolved)
print(crime_status, n=36)

### Result: Crime investigations involving intimate partners and violations of restraining orders or court orders
###         are the most likely to be resolved. Crimes involving theft and burglary are the least likely 
###         to be resolved.
